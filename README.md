# Abstract

To develop a machine learning classifier to detect circulating information whose veracity status is uncertain at the time of posting in social media in order to effectively warn users that the information may turn out to be false. Converting the textual format to vectors and then using python with its associated libraries of Scikit Learn, NumPy, Pandas, NLTK and other visualization libraries to classify the text based on the prominent features extracted while training the model

# Introduction

Social media is a popular way for people to share information and stay updated on important events. It's a tool used by both journalists and regular folks to share their thoughts and news as it happens. While it's a great way to get information quickly, there's a problem. Social media platforms don't always check the accuracy of what people post, so false information can spread easily.

For example, when there's breaking news, people often share updates without confirming if they're true. This means that some of the things shared on social media might be false. When there's no official statement to confirm or deny something, social media users often try to figure out the truth together. This process can help uncover the truth behind false information.

But because social media can spread fake news so easily, we need ways to stop it. We can use systems that collect and analyze what users think to reduce the spread of fake news. These systems can warn users when information might be false or keep track of what people are saying to see if the truth comes out over time.
